In order to provide an environment where rapid access to links allows the developer to invoke required tools for software development.<br><br> We have employed a master detail scenario for the organization of links.<br><br>
The master grid contains the overall categories while the details grid identifies the link components details available for execution.<br><br>
This application is a programmer's workbench of sorts.  
<br>The following file types accomodated include.
<ul><li>URL Links</li></li><li>PDF's</li><li>ODT (word processor)</li><li>Any executable available on the host system.</li></ul><br>Menu Popups are enabled for both master and detail grids.
